Dineoncampus is an atrocity of programming that should be nuked. Until then, this is my bot that replaces it

The texting service is in beta until April 14, expect bugs and issues until then.

This is designed to run on ubuntu, called by crontab at specific intervals daily. I used twilio for the texting service and mongodb atlas for storing user information.
